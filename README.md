# ScratchSearch
Welcome to ScratchSearch! This is a little website where you can search for Scratch forum topics.
# How does it work?
Simply type the topic you want to search for, and hit the search button. Then find the forum topic you want to view, and click it. You'll be redirected to Scratch.
# Can I search for individual posts?
Nope.
# Why are you doing this when various other forum searchers exist (ocular, scratch addons, etc.)?
because fun
# Should I switch from another forum searcher to this?
Probably not. Things like ocular let you do sooooo much more than this (like statuses, individual post searching, etc.) so I don't recommend it.
