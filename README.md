# Important
This project is no longer being developed. Here's a better forum searcher (not developed by me): https://ocular.jeffalo.net
# ScratchSearch
Welcome to ScratchSearch! This is a simple service where you can search for Scratch forum topics.
# How does it work?
Simply type the topic you want to search for, and hit the search button. Then find the forum topic you want to view, and click it. You'll be redirected to Scratch.
# Can I search for individual posts?
Nope.
# Why are you doing this when various other forum searchers exist (ocular, scratch addons, etc.)?
short answer: because fun

long answer: because i wanted to play with google programmable search.
# Should I switch from another forum searcher to this?
Definitely not. Things like ocular let you do sooooo much more than this (like statuses, individual post searching, etc.) so I don't recommend it.
